I have proven to be effective and to have the intellectual capacity to switch between:
-	the analytical skills necessary to be rigorous in content analysis, to discern critical information and to recognize value-added ones
-	and synthetic skills, when you have to do abstraction and design or when I have to take more than an overview to avoid getting lost in the details, in an area where the flow of information is permanent.

During my PHD studies I will do my best to apply all these skills to, easily and rigorously find solutions to complex problems using mathematical reasoning. Demonstrate deduction in my way of analyzing situations. and come out with schematic representations of the different situations in order to derive “models” and patterns. Seek to improve practices by questioning things, proposing new solutions, new tools, etc. while being rigorous in all aspects of my work, when the situation requires it. and Devote time to experimentation and exploration of creative solutions by establishing new and unusual connections between different elements, allowing problems to be approached from new perspectives.

It is often argued that the ability to work independently is crucial to success in a distance-learning as long as the learner is fully responsible for the learning process. I totally agree with it and I am fully aware of the amount of work that I will have to do self-regulation ,to earn my PHD from your prestigious university.
